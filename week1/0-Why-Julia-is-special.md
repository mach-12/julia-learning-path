# Why Julia is special 

## Key Features

1) Easy to learn 
    - High Level Programming Language
    - Less lines of code for tasks

2) Fast
    - Out-of-box fast speed of execution comparable to C, Fortran

3) Free
    - Open Sourced, MIT Licesnsed. (Unlike For Eg. MATLAB)

- Julia provides a unique intersection of all three features: **Easy to learn, Fast and Free**

## Technical Aspects

1) Strongly Typed and Dynamic
    - Giving types is an optional task. But by doing so, Can achieve Blazing fas speeds

2) Created for scale 
    - Parrallel programming, concurency and data models to handle large datasets makes Julia suitable for distributed and networked computing

3) Portable with other languages
    - Integration for linking Julia with C, Python, R code exist
